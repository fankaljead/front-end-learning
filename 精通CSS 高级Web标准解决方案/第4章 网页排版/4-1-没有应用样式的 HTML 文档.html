        <h1>The Moon</h1>
        <p>The <strong>Moon</strong> (in Greek: σελήνη <i>Selene</i>, in Latin: <i>Luna</i>) is Earth’s only natural
            satellite. It is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites,
            the largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest satellite
            among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter's satellite Io).</p>

        <p>The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth. There are
            several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the
            debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>

        <h2>Orbit</h2>

        <p>The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by
            dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters.
            It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth’s sky after the Sun, as measured by
            illuminance on Earth’s surface.
        </p>
        <p>Although it can appear a very bright white, its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance just slightly
            higher than that of worn asphalt. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since
            ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language, calendars, art, and mythology.</p>

        <h3>Gravitational pull &amp; distance</h3>

        <p>The Moon’s gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the
            day. The Moon’s current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth, causing it to have an
            apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun, with the result that the Moon covers the Sun
            nearly precisely in total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far
            future. The Moon’s linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 3.82 ± 0.07 centimetres
            per year, but this rate is not constant.</p>

        <h2>Lunar travels</h2>

        <p>The Soviet Union’s Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959; the
            United States’ <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> Apollo program
            achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo
            8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being Apollo 11. These
            missions returned over 380 <abbr title="kilograms">kg</abbr> of lunar rocks, which have been used to develop
            a geological understanding of the Moon's origin, the formation of its internal structure, and its subsequent
            history. After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.</p>
