        <article>
            The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
            their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they
            could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.
            Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley
            pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
            husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered
            to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
            Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even
            seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they
            didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

        <p class="source">M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
            that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
            you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
            didn’t hold with such nonsense.</p>
