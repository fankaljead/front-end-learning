        A Flash of Insight
    </h1>
    <p>

        Ives got his start as a printer’s apprentice in Ithaca, New York. After two years of learning the ins and outs
        of the printing process, he began managing the photographic laboratory at nearby Cornell University. He spent
        the rest of the decade experimenting with new photography techniques and learning about cameras, printers, and
        optics.

        In 1881, Ives had a flash of insight regarding a better printing technique.

        “While operating my photostereotype process in Ithaca, I studied the problem of halftone process,” Ives said. “I
        went to bed one night in a state of brain fog over the problem, and the instant I woke in the morning saw before
        me,
        apparently projected on the ceiling, the completely worked out process and equipment in operation.”

        Ives quickly translated his vision into reality and patented his printing approach in 1881. He spent the
        remainder
        of the decade improving upon it. By 1885, he had developed a simplified process that delivered even better
        results.
        The Ives Process, as it came to be known, reduced the cost of printing images by 15x and remained the standard
        printing technique for the next 80 years.

        Alright, now let's discuss what lessons we can learn from Ives about the creative process.
