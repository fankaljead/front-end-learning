        <h1>My use of language and my cats</h1>
        <p>My cat's behavior hasn't changed much since her absence,
        except that she plays her new physique to the neighbors
        regularly, in an attempt to get pets.</p>
        <div lang="en-GB">
            <p>My other cat, coloured black and white, is a
            sweetie. He followed us to the pool today, walking down
            the pavement with us. Yesterday he apparently visited
            our neighbours. I wonder if he recognises that their
            flat is a mirror image of ours.</p>
            <p>Hm, I just noticed that in the last paragraph I used
            British English. But I'm supposed to write in American
            English. So I shouldn't say "pavement" or "flat" or
            "colour"...</p>
        </div>
        <p>I should say "sidewalk" and "apartment" and "color"!</p>
