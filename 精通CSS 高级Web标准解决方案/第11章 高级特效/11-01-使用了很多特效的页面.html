                    <p>The Moon (in Greek: σελήνη Selene, in Latin: Luna) is Earth's only natural satellite. It is one
                        of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, and, among planetary satellites, the
                        largest relative to the size of the planet it orbits (its primary). It is the second-densest
                        satellite among those whose densities are known (after Jupiter’s satellite Io).

                        <p>The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, not long after Earth.
                            There are several hypotheses for its origin; the most widely accepted explanation is that
                            the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a
                            Mars-sized body called Theia.</p>

                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>The Sun (in Greek: Helios, in Latin: Sol) is the star at the center of the Solar System and is by
                        far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball
                        of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo
                        process. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and it has a mass about 330,000 times
                        that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.</p>

                    <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on spectral class and it is informally
                        referred to as a yellow dwarf. It formed approximately 4.567 billion years ago from the
                        gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter
                        gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar
                        System. The central mass became increasingly hot and dense, eventually initiating nuclear fusion
                        in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</p>

                    <p>The Solar System comprises the Sun and the planetary system that orbits it, either directly or
                        indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets,
                        with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar
                        System bodies such as comets and asteroids. Of those that orbit the Sun indirectly, like the
                        moons, two are larger than the smallest planet Mercury.</p>

                    <p>The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
                        interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system’s mass is in the Sun, with most of
                        the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth
                        and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer
                        planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two
                        largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the
                        two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed partially of
                        substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called ices,
                        such as water, ammonia and methane. All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a
                        nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>

                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>The Milky Way is a galaxy that contains our Solar System. Its name "milky" is derived from its
                        appearance as a dim glowing band arching across the night sky whose individual stars cannot be
                        distinguished by the naked eye. The term ”Milky Way” is a translation of the Latin via lactea,
                        from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos, "milky circle").</p>

                    <p>From Earth the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from
                        within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his
                        telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained
                        all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow
                        Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of
                        many galaxies—now known to number in the billions.</p>

                    <p>The observable universe consists of the galaxies and other matter that can, in principle, be
                        observed from Earth at the present time because light and other signals from these objects have
                        had time to reach the Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. Assuming the
                        universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same
                        in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical volume (a ball) centered on
                        the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may
                        not overlap with the one centered on Earth.</p>

                    <p>The word observable used in this sense does not depend on whether modern technology actually
                        permits detection of radiation from an object in this region (or indeed on whether there is any
                        radiation to detect). It simply indicates that it is possible in principle for light or other
                        signals from the object to reach an observer on Earth. In practice, we can see light only from
                        as far back as the time of photon decoupling in the recombination epoch. That is when particles
                        were first able to emit photons that were not quickly re-absorbed by other particles. Before
                        then, the Universe was filled with a plasma that was opaque to photons.</p>
