        On a dark winter night outside Elsinore Castle in Denmark, an officer
        named Bernardo comes to relieve the watchman Francisco. In the heavy
        darkness, the men cannot see each other. Bernardo hears a footstep near
        him and cries, “Who’s there?” After both men ensure that the other is
        also a watchman, they relax. Cold, tired, and apprehensive from his many
        hours of guarding the castle, Francisco thanks Bernardo and prepares to
        go home and go to bed.
