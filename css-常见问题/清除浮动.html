        Recently I walked into a classroom where the amazing Evie Shockley had
        just finished teaching a class of undergraduates Bhanu Kapil’s most
        recent and, to my mind one, of the most challenging books of
        contemporary poetry published in the 21st century. I stood in awe of the
        ambition to introduce the rigor of this work to beginning poets. Ban en
        Banlieue, essential reading, stands at the precipice between what is
        present and absent on a printed page. I often describe Kapil as the kind
        of writer who doesn’t settle for simply writing the books of poems she
        intended, but rather their exoskeletons. That is, books that chart her
        radical procress towards abandoning, revising, self-realizing across
        fragmentation, self-erasure and the unsayable. Look no further for a
        poet to fearlessly interrogate self, displacement, decolonization,
        geographic and cultural memory. Her blog, her Twitter, her teaching—are
        immense resources.
